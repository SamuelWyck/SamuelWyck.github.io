#### description:
During this course, you will learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged; the courseâ€™s scope and material are identical to our CS1 Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming courses. We use industry-grade tooling from day one. As such, the course is about programming in a real integrated development environment instead of a browser or an educational IDE.
