#### description: I coded this Pong game, using the pygame module in python, for my own enjoyment, and to see if I could (The recording makes the ball look a little weird). I wanted to test my hand at coding physics and the ball for pong seemed like a good place to start. To make the game single player, I made a very simple AI to control the enemy paddle that simply tries to keep the ball in front of it as much as possible. Out of all the projects Iâ€™ve tackled so far, this one fell into place very smoothly, and I even ended up adding an optional hard mode.
