This blackjack game was the second major project I ever undertook. I started the project for my own enjoyment while I was working through Harvard’s CS50X: “Introduction to Computer Science”. However, I was very happy with how the game turned out, so I made it my final project for the class. This project was my first attempt at making a game with actual graphics and sounds. Since I wasn’t using any type of game engine, I familiarized myself with the python module “pygame” which allowed me to create a display for the game. Compared to my yahtzee game, I factored and organized my code in a much more coherent manner. This project gave me an understanding of how a game is structured, and increased my confidence in my programming ability.
