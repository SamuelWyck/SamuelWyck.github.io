#### Description:
I wrote this yahtzee game as the final project for Harvardâ€™s CS50P: "Intro to programming with python". This was my first large programming project. Using pseudo graphics in the command line terminal I made a simple interface for presenting the dice and scorecard to the player, and even tracked a high score. Looking back at the code, I can see many aspects I could improve with my present experience. However, this project deepened my understanding of python and cemented a programming mindset which has helped me as I continue to learn computer science and programming.
